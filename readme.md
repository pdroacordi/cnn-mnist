# Learning Convolutional Neural Networks with Keras and TensorFlow on MNIST

This repository contains the code and resources I used to learn about Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) applied to the MNIST dataset, using the Keras and TensorFlow libraries.

## About the Project

The goal of this project is to implement and train a CNN to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. This allowed me to understand the fundamental concepts of deep neural networks and gain practical experience with Keras and TensorFlow.

## Technologies Used
* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow 2.x
* Keras (integrated with TensorFlow)
* NumPy
* Matplotlib (for visualization)
